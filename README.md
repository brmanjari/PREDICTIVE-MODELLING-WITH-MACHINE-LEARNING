# PREDICTIVE-MODELLING-WITH-MACHINE-LEARNING
🏡 Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning: House Price Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and more.

The notebook demonstrates the complete ML workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

📂 Dataset Description
Source: house_prices.csv

The dataset includes a variety of numerical and categorical features describing houses.

The target variable is the house sale price.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas, numpy – for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – for visualization

scikit-learn – for machine learning models and metrics

🔄 Workflow Summary
✅ Key steps in the notebook:

Load and inspect the dataset

Handle missing values and clean data

Encode categorical features using get_dummies()

Split data into training and testing sets

Train predictive models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Evaluate performance using metrics like R² and RMSE

(Optional) Save the trained model using joblib

📊 Visualizations
Correlation heatmaps

Distribution plots of key variables

Feature importance charts (if applicable)
